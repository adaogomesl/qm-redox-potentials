# qm-redox-potentials
Python code to automate quantum mechanical (QM) calculations, extract results, and analyze data for excited-state redox potentials. This includes input generation, job submission, parsing output files, and performing statistical and graphical analysis of computed redox properties.

## Prerequisites
- Access to a **high-performance computing (HPC) cluster**
- **Gaussian 16** and/or **GAMESS (version 2018-R1 or later)**
- **Anaconda** with **Python 3.8+**
